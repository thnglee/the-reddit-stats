# Coding patterns preferences

- Focus on the area of code relevant to the task.
- Do not touch the code that is unrelated to the task.
- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality .
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to changes being requested.
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicated logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized.
- Avoid writing scripts in file if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once.
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Never overwrite my .env without first asking or confirming.
